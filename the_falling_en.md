The train leaves Sydney at 5:37 pm and arrives at Shanghai twenty minutes later. Passengers enter Pennysbourg Station, cross security checks and enter the elevator. Each elevator receives ten thousand passengers. And there is where the endless ninety minutes passes. The company does not know what to do with them. Previously, passengers documented their luggage at the station, but now they do it in the same elevator, just to make less tedious the ascent. They also have restaurants, bars, shops and the best scenery of Sydney.
The elevator goes up to the space station Creekson, ninety kilometers up the sky as fast as possible. Covers ninety kilometers in ninety minutes. I don't know how many kilometers per hour is that. I will leave the speed calculation for the next life.
I don't have much time here. We're falling.
Once in Creekson Station, the passengers stare the fantastic six layers of glass that keep the  vacuum of the almost nonexistent atmosphere outside the lobby, along with the thousand degrees of space, or minus thousand degrees, depending on the time, the passengers stare, I say, the curvature of the planet and the slow arrival of the train. No, the train's arrival is not slow. Trips around the world in less than an hour, so it's not slow in human terms. That's, say, an illusion. The train is miles long, and looks like four cylinders tied by a rope, as imagined by the great Japanese designer who appeared in magazines and news when he designed it, or perhaps by a student who worked for free as an intern in his large firm and the great designer just took the credit, don't know. But the train takes up to one hundred thousand passengers, adding even more with more cars. Not daily. Tuesdays and Thursdays are slow days. Not today. Today, being summer, the train is at full capacity.
This particular train comes from Buenos Aires, passes through Sydney and then goes to Shanghai. There are others going to Hong Kong, Tokyo or New Delhi.
The rails are suspended at exactly ninety kilometers above Earth, such as yarn wrapped around a balloon. The rails are not made of copper or steel. They are made of ultraviolet light, almost invisible to the human. That mesh of light is emitted and repeated by beacons suspended in space in endless succession every kilometer. The train floats through the path of light. And just to make them comprehensible, or to evade late rockets, from a time before the spaceports, each beacon has a flashing white light similar to fireflies.
From the train it's impossible to watch the tracks, unless you approach a curve in the distance. But from the station, or any hotel in space, it's possible to distinguish the threads of dim light, especially at night on Earth, with the long caterpillar scrolling at any time. A human could think that the trains cross space at random times, but that is not the case. They have rigorous schedules established by the company, and are met with the accuracy of an electrical circuit. An observer from any hotel or any station, even from a telescope on Earth's surface, with a bit of time, would notice.
But I don't have much time here. No one on this train does. We're falling.
I boarded the train in Buenos Aires. Its speed slowed slightly as we approached the station Creekson and released one of the cylinders, with passengers and cargo going to Sydney, then another cylinder docked with passengers and cargo coming from Sydney, and accelerated the march to Shanghai.
Every beginner has made the mistake of being in the wrong cylinder when approaching to some destination. When that happens, you just get off at the next station and get back with the next train. It doesn't cost you a penny, because the ticket has insurance. It is also possible, although I never heard of anything like that, to stay on the train and continue there until you return to the originally planned destination, but that is not covered by insurance. A passenger may fall asleep for three stops, but then he has to get off at the next station and get back. In addition, a train could take days before returning to a station, as the automatic route designers optimize paths every second, and who knows where the train will be in five or ten stations. The designers are extraordinary machines, they use algorithms beyond human reason, no biological brain could understand them even trying as hard as possible.
We fall at an exponential rate. With a limit set by air friction. I don't know how many kilometers per hour that speed could be. I only know that the train falls to the surface in thousands of fragments, and we fall with them.
We fall at hundreds of kilometers per hour. There are drafts. There are metal fragments and dust and bits of foam, along with the sky out there, immersed in the afternoon. The only reason I can write this is because I am not writing. If I wanted to write at this moment, of course, I would never could. The writer is this program in my wrist watch. It reads my mind with its sensors, builds possible sentences, paragraphs, raises voices with what I think and see and perceive and feel and wraps it all together. Transforms three seconds in three paragraphs, I don't know, maybe five, I could not read it ever, I'll be dead in a minute. Every moment the lights are closer.
In theory, the wrist watch should pass on these pages to some other memory to another machine, far from here, simultaneously. While there is satellite coverage. However, the circuits in my watch should be able to survive the crash landing. Not that this is a very special watch. It is an older model, made of plastic. It is my only voice in this instant.
One word and one word and another. Only one word and another word and one more.
These machines, are these machines.
Just broke in two one of the cylinders and some passengers were ejected to cover part of this falling on their own. Many of them are tied to their seats, belts and coveralls released automatically in case of disaster. Mine did the same. Just heard the explosion, five or six gauze belts stronger than titanium grabbed my ankles, my legs, abdomen, chest, my arms and my forehead. None of us can move an inch. We can only scream and shake our fingers frantically. It's for our safety.
At some point foam arised from the walls. Some cars, in some cylinders, the ones closer to the blast, were covered with foam too soon. Even the cars that were atomized should have time to be transformed, for a split second, in a metal corn rose full of passengers who did not understand what happened.
Some people shouted "God, god, my god," and similar cries. I don't cry. I don't know if I believe in a god, how to believe in a god or two? Most religions only says: "Let me save you from what could happen to you if you don't want to be saved." That is, I'm not a computer, my reasoning ability is woefully limited, but something in there makes no sense.
Before falling, a passenger said the explosion was because of a gas line. It is true that the rails transmit electric power from station to station, but all that energy is generated by panels and cold reactors, not gas. How could anyone think that there are pipes and pipelines at ninety kilometers above the surface, escapes my understanding.
Maybe he and someone else still think that there was a gas explosion. But there was not.
It was a single explosion. The vibration of that instant shook the cars and the cylinders as a whip dipped in water. The explosives must have been in cargo compartments, because their sing was almost inaudible because of the vacuum an the capsule's atmosphere. That was in the beginning. But three seconds later, one or two cylinders had to split, because the atmosphere of the train disappeared and began the descent. The temperature dropped, the seat belts launched and our lips got frozen.
The train has twenty or more floaters, and can survive the demise of one. It can survive the disappearance of two floaters and three, because the drag of the other would not allow us to fall an inch. But not four. If four or more floaters disappear, the train can maintain its course with damages, as long as the rails remain in place providing thrust to the other floaters. But we are falling. If we are falling, four or more floaters disappeared with the explosion in the cargo compartment, and with the same explosion, or with another some time before, also disappeared the rails or the beacons of some kilometers and we fell through that gap.
Many no longer cry. They have died suffocated before reaching the floor. Some will freeze to dead as well. The cold is very strong. It's comforting to know that perhaps I'll die asphyxiated.
More and more lights on the surface. It is Shanghai. We were close to the station when the explosion occurred, and a colony of Shanghai is about to feel a train covered with shredded foam over them. We must be a good show now, as if a bunch on the planet fell on the city. There will be many more dead on the surface than on the train.
We are falling into the most populous city in the world. Without counting us, the train, and those who will die because of falling fragments and other machinery on them, billions will die today only with the contamination of the cold reactors. No big explosions. No bubbles of fire. Each of the three motors of this train carries a reactor. Although the authorities in Shanghai, I'm sure, are doing their best to control the situation is about to fall over them, they did not have enough time to evacuate more than a few buildings. Half of Asia will be uninhabitable.
We listen the speakers of the train. Someone is trying to say something. Who would say anything?
There is only static now. Static. May the wrist watch that writes this type the word static three or four billion times. Static.
My wrist watch writes what I'm thinking. Tries to translate fields of neurons into paragraphs and lines and phrases. Pour every second of words to a file, and if my watch works normally, other application transfers that file to another server, if we have satellite coverage, and I don't know if we have coverage. I have not seen my watch since the explosions. My arms are covered by the security tapes. Are you still writing, you? It is difficult to think coherently, without panicking. I can hardly breathe.
The wind is very strong. If we had not been grasped by the seats, with their belts, we would be bumping from one wall to another, no stop, through the air, before leaving through one of those great cracks into the sky.
The surface is so close that you can not only see the buildings and their shadows. We also see, whose who are still alive, cars lining the streets. There is a bridge that crosses from one place that exists to another that exists won't exist later. Suspended, like us, there are tracks with tiny trains with only a few hundred people, in addition to roads with more cars over the buildings. There is a road of lights until the sea.
They are the angels who inhabit these machines.
The explosives had to board in Buenos Aires or Sao Paulo, dissolved in a container. They must have been suspended in water or any other liquid, and crossed checkpoints because they were suspended in a harmless matter, as we are suspended in the air. It was after a few minutes in the motionless train movement that the explosives slowly settled, up to the point where they can explode. How they managed to squeeze them, I don't know. How could I know. That's only known by someone else, someone who is falling here with us, or maybe by someone in Sydney or any other city looking at this time all the available lines for news.
How they managed to explode them, I don't know.
My job was just to be on this train and press this button. Wait till 5:53 and press this button on my watch. I did it. Father said that would trigger the detonator.
